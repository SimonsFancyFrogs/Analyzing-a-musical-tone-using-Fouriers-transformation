# Analyzing-a-musical-tone-using-Fouriers-transformation

The code in this repository, will show what musical tone, there are in a sound file. It's original use is to give the program one single tone in the sound file, that the program should analyze. 
There have been used a combination of html code and javascript implemented in the same html file, and the p5 library to create the Fouriers-analysis (Fast Fourier-transform to be exact).
